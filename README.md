### Install and Open
1. Download the project **`ZIP file`** by clicking the green **`<> Code â–¼`** button.
2. Extract the project_name.zip folder to your desired file path/directory.
3. Open the extracted folder using an [IDE]() or text editor ([Visual Studio Code]() recommended).
### Run and Host
1. Open the terminal and make sure you are on `...\weather_app>` (I am on powershell terminal)
2. Create a virtual environment using the command:
```
python -m venv env
```
3. Install required packages using the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Move into the `weather_project` directory using the command:
```
cd weather_project
```
- You should be in `...\weather_app/weather_project>` by now

5. Run the server on localhost using the command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
